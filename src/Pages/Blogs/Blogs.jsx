                <strong className="text-dark">Authentication: </strong>
                Authentication is the act of validating that users are whom they
                claim to be. This is the first step in any security process.
                Complete an authentication process with:
                <strong className="text-dark"> Passwords-</strong>
                Usernames and passwords are the most common authentication
                factors. If a user enters the correct data, the system assumes
                the identity is valid and grants access.
                <strong className="text-dark"> One-time pins-</strong> Grant
                access for only one session or transaction.
                <strong className="text-dark"> Authentication apps-</strong>
                Generate security codes via an outside party that grants
                access.Biometrics. A user presents a fingerprint or eye scan to
                gain access to the system.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong className="text-dark">Authorization: </strong>
                Authorization in system security is the process of giving the
                user permission to access a specific resource or function. This
                term is often used interchangeably with access control or client
                privilege. <strong className="text-dark">Authorization</strong>
                in the form of permissions. Once inside, the person has the
                authorization to access the kitchen and open the cupboard that
                holds the pet food. The person may not have permission to go
                into the bedroom for a quick nap.
